# Interactive Maps in HTML Canvas.

## Description

This project showcases how to render a very big image in tiles on a HTML
canvas. Image is split and deployed to a server where the user can request
a quality of his choice to assemble the complete or cropped image. This
is used in all kind of map services, where delivery of complete dataset is
impractical and unnessecary.

## Features

- Dynamic loading of tiles from server. 
- Energy efficient rendering.
- Multiple detail levels for bandwidth conserving delivery.
- Only Vanilla Javascript without frameworks used.
